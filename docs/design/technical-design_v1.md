# .NET API Architecture with RabbitMQ and Wolverine.FX
## Technical Overview & Design Rationale

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a modern, scalable .NET API architecture that implements a publisher/subscriber (pub/sub) design pattern using RabbitMQ as the message broker and Wolverine.FX as the messaging framework. The architecture is designed to support the development of distributed, event-driven microservices that are secure, maintainable, and scalable.

The primary goals of this architecture are:

- **Decoupling services** to enable independent development, deployment, and scaling
- **Implementing resilient communication patterns** between services
- **Providing a secure API gateway** for external client access
- **Ensuring message reliability** through durable messaging patterns
- **Supporting horizontal scaling** to meet varying workload demands
- **Enabling real-time updates** through asynchronous event processing

## 2. Architecture Components

### 2.1 Client Applications Layer

**Components:**
- Web Applications (SPAs, traditional web apps)
- Mobile Applications (iOS, Android)
- Third-party Services and Integration Points

**Purpose:**
This layer represents the various clients that consume the APIs provided by the system. By implementing a unified API gateway pattern, we abstract the internal complexity of our microservices from the clients, providing them with a consistent interface regardless of the underlying service architecture.

### 2.2 Ingress Layer

**Components:**
- Nginx, Traefik, or Envoy

**Purpose:**
The ingress layer serves as the entry point for all external traffic into the system. It provides:

- **Load balancing** - Distributing incoming requests across multiple instances
- **TLS termination** - Handling HTTPS connections and certificate management
- **Basic rate limiting** - Preventing abuse through excessive requests
- **Health check integration** - Routing traffic only to healthy service instances

**Why Nginx/Traefik/Envoy:**
These technologies are industry-standard reverse proxies with proven performance at scale. They offer extensive configuration options and can be deployed in containers, making them ideal for cloud and Kubernetes environments. Traefik is particularly well-suited for containerized deployments due to its automatic service discovery capabilities.

### 2.3 API Gateway

**Components:**
- YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) or Ocelot

**Purpose:**
The API gateway serves as a unified entry point for client applications, abstracting the underlying microservice architecture. It provides:

- **Request routing** - Directing requests to appropriate microservices
- **Request aggregation** - Combining multiple service calls into a single client response
- **Protocol translation** - Converting between client-friendly protocols and internal service protocols
- **Authentication integration** - Validating tokens before forwarding requests
- **Rate limiting and throttling** - Protecting downstream services from excessive loads

**Why YARP/Ocelot:**
Both YARP and Ocelot are .NET-native API gateway solutions, making them ideal for a .NET ecosystem. YARP is Microsoft's newest offering and provides high-performance reverse proxy capabilities with a focus on extensibility. Ocelot is a mature, feature-rich API gateway specifically designed for microservices. Both integrate seamlessly with ASP.NET Core and provide the necessary features for securing and managing API traffic.

### 2.4 Identity Security Layer

**Components:**
- Identity Server (or Duende Identity Server)
- JWT Authentication

**Purpose:**
The identity security layer provides centralized authentication and authorization services for the entire architecture. It:

- **Issues and validates security tokens** - Using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards
- **Manages identity** - Handling user registration, login, and profile management
- **Implements role-based access control** - Enforcing permissions across services
- **Enables single sign-on** - Providing a unified authentication experience

**Why Identity Server:**
Identity Server is an OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 framework for ASP.NET Core that provides a complete solution for authentication and authorization. It's a mature, well-tested product that implements security best practices and integrates seamlessly with .NET applications. The JWT token approach enables stateless authentication between services, improving scalability and reducing coupling.

### 2.5 Microservices Layer

**Components:**
- Multiple independent .NET API services
- Each containing:
  - API Controllers for direct HTTP interactions
  - Wolverine Handlers for message processing
  - Domain logic and data access

**Purpose:**
The microservices layer contains the business logic of the application, divided into independently deployable services. Each service:

- **Has a specific business responsibility** - Following the single responsibility principle
- **Owns its data storage** - Maintaining domain boundaries
- **Exposes APIs** - For direct synchronous communication when needed
- **Publishes and subscribes to events** - For asynchronous communication

**Why .NET APIs with Wolverine Handlers:**
ASP.NET Core provides a robust, high-performance framework for building HTTP APIs. By adding Wolverine.FX, we gain powerful message handling capabilities that complement the HTTP endpoints. This dual approach allows services to handle both direct API calls and asynchronous messages, providing flexibility in communication patterns.

### 2.6 Message Broker Layer - RabbitMQ

**Components:**
- RabbitMQ Server
- Exchanges (for message routing)
- Queues (for message storage)
- Bindings (connecting exchanges to queues)
- Consumers (services receiving messages)

**Purpose:**
RabbitMQ serves as the central message broker, enabling reliable asynchronous communication between services. It provides:

- **Message queuing** - Storing messages until they can be processed
- **Publish/subscribe patterns** - Supporting one-to-many message distribution
- **Message routing** - Directing messages based on content or pattern matching
- **Delivery guarantees** - Ensuring messages aren't lost during processing

**Why RabbitMQ:**
RabbitMQ is a mature, battle-tested message broker with strong support for the AMQP protocol. It offers excellent performance, reliability, and a rich feature set including:

- Multiple exchange types (direct, fanout, topic, headers)
- Message persistence for durability
- Dead letter exchanges for error handling
- Publisher confirms for reliable publishing
- Consumer acknowledgments for reliable processing
- Clustering for high availability

As an open-source solution, it avoids vendor lock-in while providing enterprise-grade messaging capabilities.

6. **Open source** - Active community and transparent development

## 4. Message Flow and Communication Patterns

### 4.1 Synchronous Communication (HTTP)

Direct API calls are used when:
- **Immediate response is required** - User is waiting for the result
- **CRUD operations** - Simple data manipulation
- **Query operations** - Data retrieval with filtering and pagination
- **External client access** - Providing a standardized interface for clients

HTTP endpoints are exposed through the API Gateway, which handles authentication, routing, and optional request aggregation.

### 4.2 Asynchronous Communication (Messaging)

Messaging is used for:
- **Event notification** - Informing other services of state changes
- **Background processing** - Long-running operations
- **Cross-service workflows** - Multi-step business processes
- **System resilience** - Handling temporary service outages

#### Message Types:

1. **Commands** - Requests for a specific action to be performed
   - Usually point-to-point (one publisher, one subscriber)
   - Expect completion (success or failure)
   - Named in imperative form (`CreateOrder`, `ShipProduct`)

2. **Events** - Notifications that something has happened
   - Usually published to multiple subscribers
   - No expectation of response
   - Named in past tense (`OrderCreated`, `ProductShipped`)

3. **Queries** - Requests for information
   - Usually point-to-point
   - Expect data in response
   - Named as questions (`GetOrderStatus`, `FindCustomerById`)

### 4.3 Saga Pattern for Distributed Transactions

For operations spanning multiple services that require transactional integrity, the architecture implements the Saga pattern:

- **Choreography** - Services react to events from other services
- **Compensation** - Failed steps trigger compensating actions to maintain consistency
- **Tracking** - Saga state is persisted to monitor long-running processes

Wolverine.FX provides built-in support for sagas, making it easier to implement these complex workflows.
